Each second of a CD is 75 sectors.
There are 98 frames per sector. 2 are synchonization (not on the master, that is the DDP), 96 are data + subcode.
Each audio frame is made up of 1 byte of subcode, 2*12 bytes of data, 4 bytes of Q parity, 4 bytes of P parity.
That's why you have 24*98=2352 bytes of *useable* data per sector.
1 CD of 800MB ~ 340000 sectors, that is ~33.3M frames, which means we can also store ~32.6MB of subcode.

The subcode in on a separate file on the master.
Each subcode byte is 8 bits PQRSTUVW (or WVUTSRQP depending on the SUB layout). They are arranged in 4 packs of 24 bytes across each sector (4*24=96).
Each pack is 1 byte of mode item, 1 byte of instruction, 2 bytes of Q parity, 16 bytes of data, 4 bytes of P parity.
There seems to be a particular case when SSM=8 (Complete 2352 with R-W) where the interleaved subcode may be 4 times 24 or 18 bytes per sector. The 18-byte variant has no parity.
